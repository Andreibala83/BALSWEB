<p><font color=black><font size=10>My name is Neil Andrei E. Bala, 19 years and I live in San Miguel, Liloy Zamboanga del Norte.</p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>I was born on August 3, 2004 at Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte. My my mother’s name is  </p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>Anicita E. Bala and my father’s name is Eleno C. Bala. My mother is currently managing her</p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>own business which are cake baking and making “kakanin”. My father sadly past away last 2019</p>     
<p><font color=black><font size=10>in a cardiac arrest. Our mother is the only one who left to become our father and mother at</p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>the same time, she always do her best to fulfil our needs and taking of us with my two older</p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>sisters which is the oldest is Maria Elnie E. Bala and the second one is Leslie Joy E. Bala.</p>           
<br>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>There are lot of things that I like. I like to interact with my gadgets than socializing with</p> 
<p><font color=black><font size=10>piers and other people, I can consider myself as an introvert person for the reason that I don’t</p>   
<p><font color=black><font size=10>like spending my time going out because I can’t last a conversation with others. Beside of that I</p>   
<p><font color=black><font size=10>like to play with my pets and sometimes I play with video games and playing guitar. I spend more</p>	
<p><font color=black><font size=10>time staying at home with my family and spending more time on social media.</p>				    
<br>    					    
<p><font color=black><font size=10>I love to school because I want to gain more knowledge that I know and learn</p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>more. Another reason is that I want to finish my studies and achieve my goals </p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>and dreams at the future because I want to payback my family, piers and love ones </p>
<p><font color=black><font size=10>who supported me of what I became and what I achieved in life.</p>
